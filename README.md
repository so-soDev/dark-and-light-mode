Dark and Light Mode Toggle

This project demonstrates a simple way to implement a dark and light mode toggle in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The theme toggle is powered by a checkbox switch, which changes the theme dynamically without reloading the page.

Features

-Toggle between dark and light themes with a checkbox switch.

-Smooth transitions for background and text color.

-Custom styles for both themes using CSS variables.

Code Explanation

1) HTML Structure: Contains a checkbox input for the theme toggle and a content area with a title and paragraph.

2) CSS Styles:
-Uses CSS variables to define colors for light and dark themes.

-Transitions are applied to make the color changes smooth.

-The checkbox is styled as a switch with a moving circle indicator.

3) JavaScript Functionality: Adds an event listener to detect changes in the checkbox state. When the checkbox is checked, a data-theme="dark" attribute is added to the <html> element, triggering the dark theme styles.

How to Use

1)Clone the repository or download the files.

2)Open index.html in a web browser.

3)Toggle the switch to change between dark and light modes.
